<h1>Route beschrijving</h1>
NEMO is easily accessible by public transport. The museum's eye-catching copper-green building is easy to spot from Amsterdam Central Station. You can also reach the museum by bike or car.

<b>From Central Station</b>
On foot: A 15-minute walk. Leave the main entrance (cityside) of Central Station and turn left.<br>
By bus: Take Bus 22 and get off at Kadijksplein. From the bus stop it is a 5-minute walk. You can plan your journey at <a href="www.9292.nl">9292.nl</a> or <a href="www.gvb.nl">gvb.nl</a><br><br>
There is currently construction on the road around the Central Station. Due to diversions, the duration is sometimes slightly longer. Navigating via Google maps is not always reliable due to many changes. <br>Tip: Use ANWB routeplanner.
